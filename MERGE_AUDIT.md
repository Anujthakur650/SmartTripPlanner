# Merge Audit – final-merge-sequence-tasks-8-10-12-13-14-design-system-16

## Branch Sync Summary
- **main HEAD**: `378015f9b7bd0a7f9eef0c505654fcd067924086`
- **final-merge-sequence-tasks-8-10-12-13-14-design-system-16 HEAD**: `378015f9b7bd0a7f9eef0c505654fcd067924086`
- The integration branch in this workspace is already fast-forwarded to `main`; no additional merge commits were generated locally. Remote pull requests could not be inspected from this environment, so verification is limited to the code present in the checked-out tree.

## Task Integration Status
| Task | Scope | Status | Evidence / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Task 8 | Weather + Packing | ⚠️ **Partially integrated** | `Services/WeatherService.swift` provides WeatherKit access and is wired through `DependencyContainer`. `Features/Packing/PackingView.swift` brings the packing checklist into the tab shell (`ContentView`). Weather data is not yet surfaced in any view; wiring that UI remains outstanding. |
| Task 10 | Documents / Scanning | ⚠️ **Partially integrated** | `Features/Docs/DocsView.swift` offers document storage scaffolding with type-specific icons. No VisionKit-based scanning flow or secure document persistence is present; follow-up required. |
| Task 12 | Gmail OAuth + Parsing | ⚠️ **Partially integrated** | `Services/EmailService.swift` handles Google Sign-In and exposes authentication state, but `fetchEmails()` currently returns an empty array without Gmail API calls or itinerary parsing. |
| Task 13 | Exports PDF / GPX | ⚠️ **Partially integrated** | `Services/ExportService.swift` exports PDF and JSON and presents the share sheet. GPX generation/export is not implemented. |
| Task 14 | Offline Maps | ✅ **Integrated** | `Services/MapsService.swift` plus `Features/Map/MapView.swift` add extensive offline handling: cached searches, saved routes, fallback routes, and user messaging for offline scenarios. |
| Design System (retry) | Theme system refresh | ✅ **Integrated** | `DesignSystem/Theme.swift` defines palette, spacing, radii, and view modifiers. The theme is injected via `AppEnvironment` and used across views (`ContentView`, `TripCard`, etc.). |
| Task 16 | App Hardening | ✅ **Integrated (baseline)** | Hardening improvements are visible in `MapsService` error propagation, offline fallbacks, caching, and analytics hooks. `SyncService` centralizes CloudKit interactions and status tracking. Additional security reviews may still be advisable but the foundational infrastructure is present. |

## Conflicts & Resolutions
- No merge conflicts encountered in this workspace; branch already matches `main`.

## CI / Validation
- Automated workflows reside in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. CI was not executed from this environment, so a pipeline run should be triggered after pushing the integration branch to confirm build, lint, and test status.

## Follow-Up Recommendations
1. **Weather UI** – Surface WeatherKit data within Trips or a dedicated weather panel, ensuring graceful failure when permissions or network access are unavailable.
2. **Document Scanning & Storage** – Add a VisionKit-based scanner, secure local persistence (e.g., encrypted Core Data or Files), and metadata management for scanned documents.
3. **Gmail Import** – Implement Gmail API fetching/parsing inside `EmailService`, mapping parsed reservations into app models, and add token refresh handling.
4. **GPX Export** – Extend `ExportService` to output GPX tracks/waypoints alongside PDF/JSON, including appropriate metadata and unit tests.
5. **Testing Coverage** – Augment the unit test target to cover the new services (Weather, Email, Export, Maps) and regression-proof the offline/authorization paths.

## Conclusion
The merge-sequence branch currently mirrors `main` with the above task integrations present in code. Outstanding items for Tasks 8, 10, 12, and 13 should be scheduled to achieve full parity with the original ticket goals.
