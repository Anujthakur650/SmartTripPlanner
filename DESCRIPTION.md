# SmartTripPlanner

SmartTripPlanner is an iOS 17+ application built with SwiftUI that helps travelers research
destinations, plan itineraries, save routes, and keep essential documents in one place. The project
pairs an interactive MapKit experience with trip planning modules such as packing lists, calendar
integration, and weather forecasting.

Key modules include:

- **Map** – search destinations, review offline data, and save multi-modal routes.
- **Planner** – build daily agendas that sync to the system calendar.
- **Packing** – maintain reusable packing templates and trip-specific lists.
- **Docs** – centralize reservations and travel documents for quick access.

Refer to [`README.md`](README.md) for setup instructions and the full feature overview.
